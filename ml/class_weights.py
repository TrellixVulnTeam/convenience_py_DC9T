    """ Given the training data labels Calculates the class weights.

    Args:
        Y:      (numpy array) The training labels as class id integers.
                The shape does not matter, as long as each element represents
                a class id (ie, NOT one-hot-vectors).
        n_classes: (int) Number of possible classes.
        method: (str) The type of class weighting to use.

                - "paszke" = use the method from from Paszke et al 2016
                            `1/ln(c + class_probability)`
                - "eigen"  = use the method from Eigen & Fergus 2014.
                             `median_freq/class_freq`
                             where `class_freq` is based only on images that
                             actually contain that class.
                - "eigen2" = Similar to `eigen`, except that class_freq is
                             based on the frequency of the class in the
                             entire dataset, not just images where it occurs.
                -"logeigen2" = takes the log of "eigen2" method, so that
                            incredibly rare classes do not completely overpower
                            other values.
        c:      (float) Coefficient to use, when using paszke method.

    Returns:
        weights:    (numpy array) Array of shape [n_classes] assigning a
                    weight value to each class.
